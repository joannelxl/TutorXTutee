**About us** <br>
Tutor x Tutee is an online platform assisting Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) that aims to benefit children from low financial backgrounds. It aims to improve efficiency and reduce administrative work when offering home tutoring services to children. Tutor x Tutee helps tutors (volunteers) better manage and schedule their tutoring sessions with their tutees (beneficiaries) through matching processes, communication features, and a progress feature. With this platform, we hope to reduce the barriers to voluntary tutoring and allow tutors to focus better on the tutoring sessions.

## Accounts for testing 
Our website supports 2 different roles: tutors and tutees. Hence, we created 2 different test accounts for you to test the different functionalities (except account creation) for each role. <br>
